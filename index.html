https://github.com/soxrok2212/PSKracker/blob/master/dicts/netgear/netgear.txt


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


RULES & CODE of CONDUCT
No cheating
Maybe form teams, prize will be split
For encrypted foxes, you must find& report the PSK/passphrase
For the open network foxes, you must connect to the network & it
should automatically (you may have to open your web browser & try accessing any
website) Captive Portal you to a page with the secret key. 
??Once you have a key, submit it to your webpage "account" OR write it down & submit it to the table??

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOXES INFO
There are 17 foxes in total. Some of the fox networks are hidden. 
9 of the foxes are secured with encryption and must be cracked.
The 9 encrypted foxes are susceptible to WEP, WPA2, or WPS exploits. 
An additional 8 foxes are open network, but running on ESP8266-01 hidden throughout
the hotel. These chips have weak signals; Dope Scopes will help.

HOW-TO GUIDES, SUGGESTED METHODS

BASIC TERMINOLOGY
https://techtalk.gfi.com/wi-fi-glossary-71-terms-you-need-to-know/
https://www.datapro.net/techinfo/wifi_term.html

SETUP
Setting the wifi card to monitor mode: Find the card name with "ifconfig" (e.g. wlan0 or wlx60e327177a6b)
"sudo ifconfig wlan0 down"
"sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor"
"sudo ifconfig wlan0 up"
There are alternative methods & guides for this

Some programs(hcxtools) might throw an error about conflicting network processes. You can kill them with:
"sudo airmon-ng check kill"


WEP hacking guides

https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=simple_wep_crack
*You technically only need one wifi adapter for this hack, but it would take awhile to capture
  enough (~100,000) packets for cracking. The second wifi adpater speeds up the process

WPA2 hacking guides
https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-wi-fi-cracking-wpa2-psk-passwords-using-aircrack-ng-0148366/
ADVICE: Start with low number of Deauth frames (1-3). Too many will permanetly disconnect some devices
https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=cracking_wpa
HINT: Passwords are in Rockyou DB. They are exactly 10 digits long and should take less than 10-15minutes to crack with a laptop
*You technically only need one wifi adapter for this hack, but you would have to wait for a client
  to make a connection to the network (e.g. when your phone autoconnects to home wifi when you come home from work)
  The second wifi adapter allows us to disconnect (deauth) an already connected client. 
  If the network has no clients, you must wait or try alternative techniques, such as PMKID or WPS. 
 
PMKID Guide

WPS Guides
You can find wifi networks with WPS enbaled using Wash (installs with Reaver) or Airodump-ng -W option
PixieDust https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-wifi-using-wps-pixie-dust-attack-0162671/ 
Personalized PIN https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/wiki/Introducing-a-new-way-to-crack-WPS:-Option--p-with-an-Arbitrary-String
Brute Force https://www.kalitutorials.net/2014/04/hack-wpawpa2-wps-reaver-kali-linux.html
ADVICE: Try brute force last! Most current routers will timeout/lockout after 3 failed attempts!!
HINT: Any brute force will take less than 10 minutes

Netgear Routers with default ESSID (e.g. NETGEAR85)
https://ethaniel.me/networking/practical-wpa2-attacks-on-netgear-routers
HINT: Use the password list in Requirements. You must add 3 digit numbers
HINT: The password begins with a constonant and is in first half of alphabet

BASIC EXPLANATION OF HACKS
BASIC TERMINOLOGY
Taken from https://techtalk.gfi.com/wi-fi-glossary-71-terms-you-need-to-know/
https://www.datapro.net/techinfo/wifi_term.html

WEP - If you capture enough packets(IV initialization vectors), about 100000, from
      the network, you can crack the password with statistical methods. You can also
      add packet injection (ARP packets) to capture the 100,000 IV packets faster
      1 weblink
WPA2 - When a client (cell phone, laptop, roku) auto connects to a known WPA2 network,
       the password hash is exchanged during 4 way handshake. If you can capture 
       the handshake/hash, you can crack it offline against a wordfile. Instead of
       waiting around for a client to connect, you can disconnect an already 
       connected client with a DEAUTH packet, and the client will automatically
       reconnect with a fresh handshake. Some chipsets reveal their PSK without
       clients connected (PMKID attack)
       2 weblinks
WPS - 8 digit PIN, used as an alternative to the passphrase. It can be brute forced,
      or certain chipsets & firmwares have exploits that reveal the PIN (PixieDust)
      1 (2?) weblinks.
?Rainbow Tables? - Hashed pre-shared key is a created using the ESSID as one of the inputs.
                   If you want to create a database of wordlist that has been prehashed, you
                   have to include the target ESSID in the hashing process. Useful for
                   common/default ESSID names (NETGEAR, XyTel, etc)

HELP & FAQ
Online chat contact info (Discord? Slack?)

Q: The hack isn't working
A: The fox might be acting up and needs a reboot from the staff.

FOX HUNTING IN THE WILD
 - Wigle Mapper to find vulnerable access points within the city. Search by MAC address for vulnerable chipsets (e.g. Pixie Dust)
    https://wigle.net/
 - RouterSploit. Most routers run embedded Linux. Get CLI & root access
    https://github.com/threat9/routersploit
 - Search the Exploit Databases for more exploits
    https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33520
    https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41205
 - Most routers have their firmware publicily available online. Extract & examine with BinWalk and modify with Firmware Mod Kit
